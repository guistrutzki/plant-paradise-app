# :wrench: Install instructions

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://github.com/guistrutzki/plant-paradise-app.git`
- 1.2) `cd plant-paradise-app` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- 1.4) **[iOS]** `cd ios` and run `pod install` - if you don't have CocoaPods you can follow [these instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) to install it.
- 1.5) **[Android]** Autolink will resolve everything.

#### 2) Start your app

- 2.1) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `yarn ios` (to run on simulator) or `yarn ios --device` (to run on real device) from the root of your project. The first build will take some time.

- 2.2) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running. When ready run `yarn android` from the root of your project.
